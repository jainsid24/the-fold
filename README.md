## Overview

**The Fold** is a surreal, hypertext-driven narrative about recursion, containment, and fractured identityâ€”unfolding through the interface of a haunted terminal.

## Tech Stack

- **SugarCube 2.37.3** â€” Interactive fiction engine
- **Custom CSS / Animation**:
  - CRT emulation with scanlines & phosphor decay
  - RGB-channel glitch transitions & chromatic aberration
  - Parametric feedback loops for screen distortion
- **JavaScript Engine**:
  - Recursive state machine with persistent memory
  - Voice-based agents with competing priorities
  - Procedural text rendering & UI responsiveness
- **SVG Runtime** â€” For vector-based terminal interface layers
- **WebAudio API** â€” Generative ambient score via granular synthesis

## Key Features

- **Recursive Memory System** â€” Story remembers previous cycles
- **Competing Voice Architecture** â€” Narrative agents in dynamic tension
- **CRT Terminal Emulation** â€” Diegetic UI with glitch & decay
- **Adaptive Sound Design** â€” Procedural audio reacting to story state
- **Evolving Narrative Paths** â€” Choices ripple through recursion

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jainsid24/the-fold.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd the-fold

# Run with a local server (recommended)
python -m http.server   # Requires Python 3.x
```

Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in your browser, or import `the-fold.twee` into [Twine](https://twinery.org/) to explore or edit the narrative structure.

## Implementation Notes

This project extends SugarCubeâ€™s engine to support advanced narrative mechanics:

- **Voice System** â€” Modular agents influencing outcomes through a shared tension model
- **Recursion Tracking** â€” Story state evolves across loops, creating layered memory
- **Glitch Visuals** â€” Visuals tied to narrative dissonance using parametric shaders
- **Procedural Audio** â€” Soundscapes generated dynamically with WebAudio nodes
